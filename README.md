Explore my JavaScript practice repository, featuring a collection of solved tasks and exercises 

There are a list of tasks: 
1. Create a script that counts and logs the number of categories in ul#categories, then prints each category's heading (h2 tag) text and the count of its elements (all nested li elements), utilizing forEach() method and DOM navigation properties.

3. Generate `<li>` elements for each ingredient in the 'ingredients' array, assigning their names as text content, adding the 'item' class, and inserting them collectively into the ul#ingredients list.
4. Generate an image gallery using the 'images' array to create `<img>` elements inside `<li>` tags within the ul.gallery in HTML, inserting them into the DOM with a single operation.
5. Create a counter with buttons to increment or decrement its value by one on click, updating the interface accordingly.
6. Script updates span#name-output with input#name-input text, showing 'Anonymous' if the input is empty.
7. Script checks input content on blur event, validating the input length according to the specified data-length attribute. The input border turns green for the correct length and red for an incorrect length using predefined CSS classes.
8. Script responds to changes in input#font-size-control (on 'input' event), dynamically altering the inline style of span#text by updating the font-size property. Dragging the slider will consequently adjust the text size.
9. Script manages a login form:
    - Handles form submission, preventing page reload.
    - Alerts if any field is empty.
    - Gathers field values into an object on successful submission, logging it to the console.
    - Clears form fields after submission.
10. Script changes body background color on button.click and displays the color value in span.color using getRandomHexColor().
11. Script manages creating and clearing a collection of resizable colored boxes based on user input.
